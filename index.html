                    <p>My name is Kory Attleson. I was born in small town Iowa and am currently going through a bootcamp through devCodeCamp. </p>
                    <p>I orginally never saw myself working in tech until I made the decision to jump into this bootcamp. I've been a manger in a grocery store, shingled roofs, worked on farms, ran a seafood department, and worked two years as an accountant, but never though tech would be the next field I jumped into.</p>
                    <p>My interest in getting into the tech field started in college when I was bored some nights and dabbled in HTML and CSS building simple websites (like the one you're on right now). I also took some free courses online, but never took my interest in web development any further.</p>
                    <p>As life came about I saw an opportunity to take a 3 month bootcamp to jumpstart my career into the tech industry without having to go through 4 years of college and take on a large debt load.</p>
                    <p>Although I am still in the bootcamp the languages I've learned so far are JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, and a little dabbling in MySQL. I still have a long way's to go, but look forward to see what opportunities lie before me.</p>
